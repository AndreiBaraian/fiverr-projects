I
walked
down
alone
Sunday
after
church
To
the
place
where
John
has
been
cutting
trees
To
see
for
myself
about
the
birch
He
said
I
could
have
to
bush
my
peas
The
sun
in
the
newcut
narrow
gap
Was
hot
enough
for
the
first
of
May
And
stifling
hot
with
the
odor
of
sap
From
stumps
still
bleeding
their
life
away
The
frogs
that
were
peeping
a
thousand
shrill
Wherever
the
ground
was
low
and
wet
The
minute
they
heard
my
step
went
still
To
watch
me
and
see
what
I
came
to
get
Birch
boughs
enough
piled
everywhere
All
fresh
and
sound
from
the
recent
axe
Time
someone
came
with
cart
and
pair
And
got
them
off
the
wild
flowers
backs
They
might
be
good
for
garden
things
To
curl
a
little
finger
round
The
same
as
you
seize
catscradle
strings
And
lift
themselves
up
off
the
ground
Small
good
to
anything
growing
wild
They
were
crooking
many
a
trillium
That
had
budded
before
the
boughs
were
piled
And
since
it
was
coming
up
had
to
come
I
had
for
my
winter
evening
walk
No
one
at
all
with
whom
to
talk
But
I
had
the
cottages
in
a
row
Up
to
their
shining
eyes
in
snow
And
I
thought
I
had
the
folk
within
I
had
the
sound
of
a
violin
I
had
a
glimpse
through
curtain
laces
Of
youthful
forms
and
youthful
faces
I
had
such
company
outward
bound
I
went
till
there
were
no
cottages
found
I
turned
and
repented
but
coming
back
I
saw
no
window
but
that
was
black
Over
the
snow
my
creaking
feet
Disturbed
the
slumbering
village
street
Like
profanation
by
your
leave
At
ten
oclock
of
a
winter
eve
When
I
was
just
as
far
as
I
could
walk
From
here
today
There
was
an
hour
All
still
When
leaning
with
my
head
against
a
flower
I
heard
you
talk
Dont
say
I
didnt
for
I
heard
you
say
You
spoke
from
that
flower
on
the
window
sill
Do
you
remember
what
it
was
you
said
First
tell
me
what
it
was
you
thought
you
heard
Having
found
the
flower
and
driven
a
bee
away
I
leaned
my
head
And
holding
by
the
stalk
I
listened
and
I
thought
I
caught
the
word
What
was
it
Did
you
call
me
by
my
name
Or
did
you
say
Someone
said
ComeI
heard
it
as
I
bowed
I
may
have
thought
as
much
but
not
aloud
Well
so
I
came
Im
going
out
to
clean
the
pasture
spring
Ill
only
stop
to
rake
the
leaves
away
And
wait
to
watch
the
water
clear
I
may
I
shant
be
gone
longYou
come
too
Im
going
out
to
fetch
the
little
calf
Thats
standing
by
the
mother
Its
so
young
It
totters
when
she
licks
it
with
her
tongue
I
shant
be
gone
longYou
come
too
You
were
forever
finding
some
new
play
So
when
I
saw
you
down
on
hands
and
knees
In
the
meadow
busy
with
the
newcut
hay
Trying
I
thought
to
set
it
up
on
end
I
went
to
show
you
how
to
make
it
stay
If
that
was
your
idea
against
the
breeze
And
if
you
asked
me
even
help
pretend
To
make
it
root
again
and
grow
afresh
But
twas
no
makebelieve
with
you
today
Nor
was
the
grass
itself
your
real
concern
Though
I
found
your
hand
full
of
wilted
fern
Steelbright
Junegrass
and
blackening
heads
of
clover
Twas
a
nest
full
of
young
birds
on
the
ground
The
cutterbar
had
just
gone
champing
over
Miraculously
without
tasting
flesh
And
left
defenseless
to
the
heat
and
light
You
wanted
to
restore
them
to
their
right
Of
something
interposed
between
their
sight
And
too
much
world
at
oncecould
means
be
found
The
way
the
nestfull
every
time
we
stirred
Stood
up
to
us
as
to
a
motherbird
Whose
coming
home
has
been
too
long
deferred
Made
me
ask
would
the
motherbird
return
And
care
for
them
in
such
a
change
of
scene
And
might
our
meddling
make
her
more
afraid
That
was
a
thing
we
could
not
wait
to
learn
We
saw
the
risk
we
took
in
doing
good
But
dared
not
spare
to
do
the
best
we
could
Though
harm
should
come
of
it
so
built
the
screen
You
had
begun
and
gave
them
back
their
shade
All
this
to
prove
we
cared
Why
is
there
then
No
more
to
tell
We
turned
to
other
things
I
havent
any
memoryhave
you
Of
ever
coming
to
the
place
again
To
see
if
the
birds
lived
the
first
night
through
And
so
at
last
to
learn
to
use
their
wings
